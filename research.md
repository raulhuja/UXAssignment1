# Compare and Contrast Educational Goals

- When contrasting my focus on GPA and campus involvement to the article "Student Portfolios and the College Admissions Problem," the differences lie in my personal goal of maintaining a strong GPA and getting involved on campus is more about excelling within the university environment, not just gaining admission into a university. For me, it's about long-term success, both academically and socially.
